What characteristics distinguish a great film? The first things that come to mind are an engaging story,
standout acting from the cast, a fitting and memorable soundtrack, and excellent graphics.
A more informed spectator will also be interested in the film's direction and photography, and some
films must meet requirements set forth by the genre they belong to (for example, horror films must be
tense and terrifying). 

Movies are frequently evaluated based on the message they hope to deliver or the
applicability of their themes. Even though this is a simplified perspective, it is clear that many of the
factors that influence whether or not a movie is good are arbitrary or difficult to measure.
A key source of international trade and marketing nowadays, movies are no longer the only means of
entertainment. In particular, among young people, movies start a new enthusiasm. The general public
is likewise interested in the success of movies, in addition to movie directors and box office officials.
These topics used to be discussed on social media. Consequently, social media data analysis about
movies has recently gained popularity among data analysts.


In addition to this, there are still some other opportunities, such as researching an actor's or director's
past successes. Once more, the analysis may vary depending on the country. Naturally, people from
different parts of the world have different reactions.
Today, you may watch movies online. People can publish their movie reviews on websites like IMDb
(Internet Movie Database), Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritics, etc. These sites are growing in popularity
day by day since they provide individuals with frank reviews. Therefore, there is a wealth of
information on movie reviews and ratings online. This article analyzes movie rating data in order to
forecast movie ratings.


As people are very enthusiastic about movies, there are many studies that attempt to forecast the
success rate of movies. Very few studies use a movie's attributes to forecast its success rate, including
the director, screenplay, actor or actress, genre, etc. Therefore, the goal of this article is to forecast the
success rate using the movie's own features.
